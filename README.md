House Price Prediction Model
============================

This project involves developing a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various features using Linear Regression. The dataset used consists of house sales data from India, and the model is designed to assist in understanding the factors that influence house prices and providing estimates for potential buyers, sellers, or real estate analysts.

Project Overview
----------------

-   **Model**: Linear Regression
-   **Dataset**: House sales data from India
-   **Key Metrics**:
    -   **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 0.2927
    -   **R² Score**: 0.7089

Features
--------

The model predicts house prices based on the following features:

-   **Area**
-   **Location**
-   **Number of Bedrooms**
-   **Number of Bathrooms**
-   **Year Built**
-   **Other relevant features**

Data Preprocessing
------------------

1.  **Data Cleaning**:

    -   Handled missing values.
    -   Removed duplicate entries.
    -   Dropped irrelevant columns such as 'ID' and 'Date'.
    -   Renamed columns for consistency and easier manipulation.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

    -   Analyzed data distribution, outliers, and correlations between features.
    -   Visualized key insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
3.  **Feature Engineering**:

    -   Optimized feature selection to improve model performance.

Model Development
-----------------

-   **Algorithm**: Linear Regression
-   **Training and Testing**: The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
-   **Model Evaluation**:
    -   The model was evaluated using MSE and R² score to assess accuracy and fit.

Results
-------

The model achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.2927 and an R² score of 0.7089, indicating a good fit and reliable predictions for house prices within the dataset.

Tools & Technologies
--------------------

-   **Programming Language**: Python
-   **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Usage
-----

To use the model:

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    bash

    Copy code

    `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git`

2.  **Install the required libraries**:

    bash

    Copy code

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:

    bash

    Copy code

    `jupyter notebook HousePricePrediction.ipynb`

Conclusion
----------

This project provides a foundation for predicting house prices using linear regression. With further refinement and additional data, the model can be enhanced to deliver even more accurate predictions.

Future Work
-----------

-   Incorporating more advanced regression techniques or other machine learning models.
-   Expanding the dataset to include more regions or more recent data.
-   Integrating the model into a web application for real-time price predictions.
